# Assignments

There will be two kinds of assignments in this course: homeworks and projects.
Homeworks are smaller, more structured assignments that will be due each week.
Each homework will match up with a single topic and will generally be due at the
end of the week during which we discuss that topic. Projects, on the other hand,
are much larger and will involve a great deal of self-direction. These will be
due periodically throughout the semester and may include material from several
topics.

## Homeworks

  * [Functional Testing](../topics/functional-testing/assignment/)
  * [Unit Testing](../topics/unit-testing/assignment/)
  * [Dependency Injection](../topics/dependency-injection/assignment/)
  * [Code Review](../topics/code-review/assignment/)
  * [Integration Testing](../topics/integration-testing/assignment/)
  * [Linters and Formatters](../topics/linters-and-formatters/assignment/)

## Projects

### Complex Codebase Assignment

Now that you’ve had time to become familiar with the code your capstone group
mates have written, it is time to write some tests. You will each be responsible
for writing several tests for the group’s code, described below.

Unit tests - choose one class, or several functions, and write unit tests for
them. You may need to make changes to the code to make it easier to test. You
should produce at least 10 unit tests that cover at least three methods or
functions.

Functional / integration tests - create one end-to-end functional integration
test. This might be a command line test, in which case you can use Commander, or
it can be a browser-based test using Puppeteer.

Submit your code through Moodle as a ZIP file, along with an explanation of what
you tested and any changes to the code you made to aid in testing.
