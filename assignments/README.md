# Assignments

There will be two kinds of assignments in this course: homeworks and projects.
Homeworks are smaller, more structured assignments that will be due each week.
Each homework will match up with a single topic and will generally be due at the
end of the week during which we discuss that topic. Projects, on the other hand,
are much larger and will involve a great deal of self-direction. These will be
due periodically throughout the semester and may include material from several
topics.
