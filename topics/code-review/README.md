# Code Review

Code review is a technique whereby a developer's work is inspected by one or
more colleagues before being included in a codebase. Code review is sometimes
used to check for security issues or enforce code styles, but it can be helpful
as a tool to prevent ordinary bugs from creeping into a codebase as well.

We're going to look at the following in class:

  1. What is it and what to look for
  2. Kinds of code review
  3. Example code reviews
