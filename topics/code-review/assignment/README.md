# Code Review Assignment

**Part 1** Poke around on [GitHub](https://github.com) and find three pull
requests that demonstrate good code review practices. Check the repositories for
software that you use or have heard about. Describe what the reviewers commented
on and why the comments were (or weren't) helpful. Also, describe what the
reviewers seemed to be looking for.

**Part 2** Talk to your capstone group mates about how they do, or could, use
code review to improve their software. If they already use code review, find out
how they do it, what they look for, and how they feel about it. If they don't,
find out if they've considered it, why they have chosen not to, and how they
might implement it in the future. Basically, have a conversation and try to
understand how code review does, or could, help the project.

Submit a document (PDF preferred) through Moodle that contains your responses.
