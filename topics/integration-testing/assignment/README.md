# Integration Testing Assignment

Using the example application we worked with in class, found in the
[example/](../example/) directory, create a functional integration test that
creates a message and verifies that entering the correct password decodes the
message. Your test should pass when the application is running with the real
encryption code, it doesn't need to pass when using fake encryption.

You should use Puppeteer and Chai for your test, see the example for how to set
this up.
