# Reliability Defined

At the end of the day, it is our job as software developers to help people solve
problems. Sometimes these problems are glamorous, like launching satellites, and
sometimes they are mundane, like filing taxes. In the same way, the consequences
of faulty software are sometimes grave, and sometimes they are just mildly
irritating. But either way, we owe it to ourselves, our profession, and people
whose problems we help to solve, to produce reliable software. In fact, in some
sense, if the software we produce is unreliable, then we haven't really solved a
problem at all.

Unfortunately, building reliable software is challenging. Even seemingly simple
problems often harbor hidden layers of complexity, and therefore require
correspondingly more complex software to solve. This additional complexity has a
strong tendency to reduce reliability, through bugs, degraded performance, and
just simple human error.

Generally, we find that to achieve reliability we must carefully manage this
complexity, which will be the overriding theme of this course. There are many
techniques and practices that can help us do this, and these will form the
majority of the content of this course.
