# Unit Testing Homework

We're going to write some unit tests for a simple piece of software that I will
provide. The code is currently un-tested, so it is your job to identify specific
units, then write tests.

There is documentation that describes what each function is supposed to do, use
this to write your tests. Read it carefully!

Note that the code may contain bugs, so some of your tests may fail. That's fine
(in fact, it's the whole point)!

You should use both doctests and standard unit tests. A good rule of thumb is
that doctests should be preferred unless the test takes more than two or three
lines of code (since, at that point, the test can become hard to read).

You should submit the directory that contains the code, as a ZIP file, with your
tests added.
